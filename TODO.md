### short 

- public api
- private api

---

- apigw method api vs endpoint
- apigw per endpoint resource definition
- apigw public, private endpoint definition

- AWS::Route53::RecordSet
- AWS::Lambda::Permission
- AWS::IAM::Role

- resource rendering
- component base class

### medium

- replace website binary media types with `*/*`
- replace default/medium/long for size/timeout with integer values
- remove dsl.expand globals arg
- index which references table doesn't force table to exist
- see if script component properties can be genericised
- replace setup.py with pyproject.toml

### features

- lambda alarms 
- apigateway2
- federated auth
- passwordless auth
- secrets
- step functions

### thoughts

- does dehungarorise() need to take into account initials and numbers?
  - have to see
- permissions, size/timeout tests?
  - not sure it adds anything
- nest tests?
  - think it obfuscates stuff
- remove yaml dependency?
  - no; too much yaml everywhere
- fold website into bucket?
- refactor action -function as -action (?)
- apigw logging?
  - not clear you need it as alex de brie says is very verbose
  - and once you have the apigw patterns down, it's probably superfluous
- separate api cognito package?
  - doesn't make any sense
- userpool should be named private-api?
  - can't think why I wanted to do this
- make database and bucket fixed assets, like errors?
- seems inconsistent that table has an appname prefix but api does not
- push_artifacts.py didn't seem to throw exception on bad POST schema in infa
  - problem is that endpoint schema is only required to be an object with no validation
- why do I get occasional permissions problems because schema seems to allow (incorrect) attributes at root level ?
  - unclear :(
- check for duplicate event names ?
  - probably not much necessary
- check for empty model schema ?
  - not worth it
- GET endpoint should allow blank parameters ?
  - better to be explicit
- add handler for blank infra (or exception) ?
  - not sure
- validate schema format ?
  - leave as free- form
- infer GET/POST from parameters/schema?
  - no is probably clearer not to
- apply table defaults at root table level?
  - no because is more complex, applied at nested level
- consider refactoring event topic, pattern as head, body?
  - think topic, pattern probably more naturalg
