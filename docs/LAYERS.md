- layers are great if you use large packages like numpy / scipy / scikit learn
- you don't want to bundle these with app deployment as they can be huge and can dwarf the size of your app - doing so can slow your deployment velocity down a lot
- the more so if you have multiple services using the same package and each is deploying it independently!
- with layers you can make the package available to your apps just like it was part of the stdlib environment
- but layers can be a pain to build and manage
- for a start it's a two part process - push the layers assets to S3 (like lambda deployment) then deploy the layer from those assets
- but have to be careful how layer assets are compiled in the former step, as has to target the lambda operating system (amazon Linux)
- fortunately codebuild has images which use the same underlying AMIs as lambda
- hence build a package / layer assets with codebuild, and it will work with lambda
- pareto has scripts to help with this
- first script creates a codebuild project with a buildspec to fetch and build a pip/git package, and push the results to s3
- second script deploys layer from resulting S3 assets
- result is a layer ARN (reference!) which can be bundled with any pareto project
