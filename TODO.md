### short [streaming-table]

- move stream config inline 
  - replace with streaming boolean

### medium

- queue+function
- add memory and timeout to existing timer inline function 
- abstract inline function, role generation
- per- stage config
- resource names of timer functions should be checked against actions
- topic test harness
- topic policy specifies events as principal ?
- builder, topic, router? dashboards
- explicit action destination, dsl (boolean) fields
- metadata schema
- scaffold cli

### gists

- api keys
- eventbridge destination urls
- eventbridge lambda destination

### long

- burningmonk apigw stuff
- lambda alarms, timeouts
- appsync + graphql
- step functions
- iam role lockdown
- aws chat

### thoughts

- consider removing table error handling ?
  - no seems valuable tbh
- add check for function name conflict  ?
  - it's implicit because -function suffix != -timer-function suffix
- timer checks for exceeding queue length ?
- python deployment script ?
  - is probably fine to have just a shell option, even if slightly more inconvenient; you're not supposed to be investing in the cli really
- codebuild output option
 - https://stackoverflow.com/a/67192915/124179
- some kind of s3 error on stack deployment ?
  - replaced py version with sh
- change deployent to use template body rather than template URL ?
  - problem is max of 51.2k bytes
- codebuild project ?
  - not sure it's a core component, more like a something one- off
- check metadata components can be optional ?
  - not really possible with current metadata structure which uses objects
  - not even sure is really desirable; may be better to explicitly all keys but then allow them to be empty lists
- flatten nested config items where possible ?
  - no real need if no metadata schema, and possibly not even then
- dashboard should not require specification ?
  - think it's probably best made explicit for now
- add check so type can't appear in component name ?
  - probably too tightly prescriptive
- replace action with function ?
  - no particular need, esp if no type checking as per above
- consider nesting events under router ?
  - no think things are fine as they are 
- table stream shouldn't be defined as part of config ?
  - no is fine; is already abstracted somewhat
- simplify validate_async_errors
  - no is fine
- use QueueNamePrefix when looking up queues ?
  - probably not worth it
- failure options for s3 notifications ?
- is s3 invocation of lambda is synchronous ?
- compact dsl ?
- clean up all init resource/output functions ?
  - not worth it
- avoid userpool/userpool_ nomenclature ?
  - not worth it
- stop symlink creating pareto2/pareto2 ?
  - probably overkill at this stage
- action to validate binding uniqueness ?
  - probably overkill at this stage
- remove eventbus discoverer ?
